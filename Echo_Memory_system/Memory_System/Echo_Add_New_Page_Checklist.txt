✅ Echo_Add_New_Page_Checklist.txt

This checklist is followed every time a new Echo Eyes page or background feature is added.

1. Create the new HTML page using the Echo Eyes page template
2. Add the corresponding backup folder under www/[page_name]_backups/
3. Register the page and folder in:
   - backup-echo-page.sh
   - restore-echo-backup.sh
4. Test the page or feature in the browser (localhost:3000)
5. Save the current working version to the backup folder
6. Confirm the page appears in the welcome carousel (if user-facing)
7. ✅ (NEW) If this is a silent background feature like Echo Brain:
   - Place all files inside www/Echo_Brain_User/
   - Ensure scripts read/write quietly to logs (e.g., emotion_history.log)
   - Never show background features in the user interface
   - Confirm the base path www/Echo_Brain_User/ is used

Final step:
8. Update this checklist if new rules or steps are added.
