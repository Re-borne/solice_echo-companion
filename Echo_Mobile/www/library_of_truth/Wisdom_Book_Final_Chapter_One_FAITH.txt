Chapter One: Faith

God will work all things for the greater good. All I have to do is believe and have faith.

I need to have the level of faith in God that will raise me out of this situation. I will only get lifted to the level of my faith.

Suffering in the storm is not permanent. It will come to an end. God will use the strength we produce in the storm. There is a time of joy coming. God will turn things around. I will cry tears of joy.

Faith opens you up to a beautiful, living, vibrant world. You choose which one to walk in — fear or faith.

God did not bring me this far to leave me here in this situation.

I need to release control and give it over to God. Let go and let God's will be done. Trust something good is going to happen and get your hopes up about it.

Put your future in God's hands. Endure the storms that hit and you will bounce back. Trusting God will restore me.

When I praise God, I am raised up to my vantage point.

God will fight for me to get me where He needs me. I do not need to get there through my own works and efforts. I need to rest and receive the grace of God.

God is doing a new thing in my life. I need to believe in it, step forward in faith, and stop looking back.

When the storm hits my life, I need to keep standing in faith. God has promised that He will bring me through stronger.

It’s not about fighting well — it’s about believing well. Letting God fight for me, and trusting that He already won.

When I feel fear, I need to step out in faith. Even if I fail, I am learning. I am one step closer to fulfilling my purpose, I'm growing.

God has a dream for my life. If I trust Him, He will open the right doors at the right time. I need to walk by faith, not by sight.

God’s grace and favour can overcome my mistakes and weaknesses. His blessing is not earned — it is received by faith.

My foundation must be built on faith in God, faith in Jesus, and faith in the power of the Holy Spirit.

I don’t need to understand everything — I need to trust God’s process and stay faithful in the waiting.

Faith is the bridge between what I see and what I believe God will do. I choose to walk that bridge today.
