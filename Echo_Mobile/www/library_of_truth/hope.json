  "Chapter Three: Hope",
  "I need to have a positive expectation that my future is going to be bright. I will make it out of this storm to the peaceful future God has for me.",
  "Hope produces action. When I hope, I move forward.",
  "Trust God — hope for what is in your heart, and you will receive more than you could have ever dreamed or hoped for.",
  "My setback has not disqualified me from my destiny. God uses everything to prepare me for what’s ahead.",
  "There is still hope. I am not dead yet. There is another miracle just around the corner.",
  "I may feel trapped between my purpose and my problems, but God will show me a way. He always does.",
  "God has already arranged the healing and breakthrough I need — I just need to stay in hope and faith.",
  "God has not brought me this far to leave me now. He will carry me the rest of the way.",
  "Every delay is not a denial. Sometimes it’s just God preparing a better outcome than I imagined.",
  "Hope is not a weak wish. It is a strong anchor tied to God’s faithfulness.",
  "God is still writing my story. It’s not over yet — there’s something beautiful still to come.",
  "What I am going through is only temporary. Joy will come. God will bring beauty from these ashes.",
  "The storm is not the end — it’s the path to something better. I will hold on to hope.",
  "When I speak out in hope, I begin to change the atmosphere around me.",
  "There is nothing too broken for God to heal. There is always hope in His hands.",
  "God will surprise me with blessings I didn’t see coming. I will wait with hope.",
  "I choose hope, even when I don’t feel it — because God is still with me.",
  "Hope lifts my eyes. It helps me see beyond the struggle to the promise God has made. To the vision he has put in my heart."
