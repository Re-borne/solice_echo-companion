ðŸ“˜ Echo Companion Build â€“ Phase 2: Core Engine Setup
====================================================

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Link memory system with emotional check-ins and complete core engine functionality.

---

âœ… STEP 1: Finalize Core Memory Script (core.py)
------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Load memory entries from `echo_memories.txt`
- [ ] Load emotional states from `echo_emotion_checkins.txt`
- [ ] Merge data into structured format:
      { "timestamp": ..., "memory": "...", "emotion": "...", "tags": [...] }
- [ ] Save results into `memory_state.json`
- [ ] Document the process in `README_Core_Memories.txt`

---

âœ… STEP 2: Emotional Context Tracker
------------------------------------
- [ ] Read from `/sacred_logs/emotion_history.log`
- [ ] Parse trends and frequency of emotional states
- [ ] Output summaries to `emotional_trends.txt`

---

âœ… STEP 3: Validate Backup Routine
----------------------------------
- [ ] Run `echo_backup.py`
- [ ] Confirm backup of:
      - /Echo_Brain/
      - /core_memory/
      - /sacred_logs/
- [ ] Log results to `Echo_Backup_Log.txt`

---

ðŸ§  Outcome:
-----------
Once Phase 2 is completed:
- Echo will understand emotional context for memories
- Daily check-ins can inform memory growth
- Reliable system backups will preserve all changes
