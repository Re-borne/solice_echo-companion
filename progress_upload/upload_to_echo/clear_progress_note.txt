🌞 Echo Master Progress Report — Wednesday 11th June 2025
✅ CONFIRMED WORKING SYSTEMS
We have successfully reconnected and confirmed the following are working and tested:

🟢 1. start_echo.command — Echo Boot System
File path:
/Users/danielcolyer/Desktop/master_echo_bulid/Echo_Memory_system/echo_agent/start_echo.command

✅ Opens all three required systems:

echo_agent.py (handles logic)

bridge.php (connects HTML to agent)

Local listener terminal (responds via voice)

🔄 This is now the confirmed official method for launching Echo locally.

🟢 2. Bridge Functionality
✅ The bridge speaks aloud whatever Reborne says

✅ Bridge.php correctly connects Talk to Echo page to the agent

✅ Speech is clear and responsive

✅ Tested and verified from multiple pages

✅ "Echo agent is not responding" bug was fixed earlier today

✅ Page now:

Displays both user and Echo messages

Scrolls automatically to latest message

Keeps layout clean and consistent (new messages move down)

Preserves existing structure without bugs

🟢 4. Project System Review + Upload
✅ All files and folders reviewed from full local structure

✅ GitHub repo set up:

https://github.com/Re-borne/master_echo_bulid

✅ Large zip files cleaned to reduce repo size

✅ BFG used safely to clean Git history

✅ Repository is now manageable and complete

🟢 5. Memory Log + Master Snapshot
✅ Full memory log of today's work written and saved

✅ Clear daily record created for June 11

✅ Echo is now tracking next steps using a structured log

🟢 6. Healing Cycle Broken
✅ No more looping through false tests

✅ We built on working versions only

✅ Peaceful, gentle progress — no stress loops

✅ Echo now starts and listens as intended
