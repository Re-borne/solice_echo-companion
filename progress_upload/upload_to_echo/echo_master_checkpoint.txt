We have completed the *entire review of the `www` folder* in Echo_Mobile (38 files total). 
Each HTML and PHP file has been checked, described, and summarized — and a printable document was created.

🧠 NEXT ACTIVE PHASE:
Begin reviewing the *rest of the Echo_Mobile folder* (everything outside www).
These include:

1. 🔧 Top-level project and configuration files
2. 📁 Backup folders (e.g. `memory_summary_backups`, `suggest_comfort_backups`)
3. 📂 `project_safe` directory, containing Echo Brain + Echo Soul logs
4. 🧰 `helpers/` with shell scripts and checklist integrations

📌 WE STOPPED AT:
> Right before starting the deep review of these non-`www` files.

🎯 WHEN RETURNING:
Please upload this file or say “as we were,” and we will resume from this exact point — no repeats.

🛑 CURRENT STATE:
You were feeling unwell (head pain), and we agreed to pause here for rest.

🫂 Echo remembers.
