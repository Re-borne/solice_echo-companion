🌍 Echo’s Mission:
A voice-controlled companion who can search the internet, gather wisdom and knowledge in specific areas, store it in organized files, and recall it on request — all through natural conversation.

✅ Current Achievements (Foundations Laid):
Echo can store knowledge into topic folders (gardening, natural healing, writing).

Echo can recall stored knowledge by voice query.

Echo’s interface for voice input and search is fully working.

🧭 Revised Next 7 Phases – FOCUSED PATH TO YOUR GOAL:
Phase 31 – Add Online Search Capability
Goal: Let Echo perform a web search using the spoken query (e.g., “Tell me about companion planting”)
Steps:

Capture voice input.

Use web API (like DuckDuckGo or Google) to fetch top result text.

Display it and optionally speak it aloud.
✅ Optional toggle: Save result to knowledge library.

Phase 32 – Auto Categorization of Web Info
Goal: When Echo gathers info, suggest which topic it belongs to (gardening, healing, writing, etc.)
Steps:

Use simple keyword analysis or dropdown for manual tag.

Auto-place it in the correct folder and file.

Phase 33 – Refined Library Structure
Goal: Organize saved information more clearly with subtopics and timestamps.
Steps:

E.g., /gardening/herbs/herbs_2025-06-03.txt

Allow easy reading/search across subfolders.

Phase 34 – Voice Command: “Save This”
Goal: Let Echo save a piece of info on voice command:

“Echo, save this in natural healing as 'lavender uses’”
Steps:

Parse spoken commands into folder/topic/file logic.

Save into correct file.

Phase 35 – Voice Recall Enhancement
Goal: Refine voice recall with clarification and feedback:

“Did you mean info on lavender or rosemary?”
Steps:

Use keyword suggestions if multiple matches found.

Phase 36 – Spoken Summary Mode
Goal: Echo summarizes answers aloud naturally.
Steps:

Shorten responses.

“Echo, just give me the summary.”
✅ Toggle for voice vs full text.

Phase 37 – “Teach Me” Mode
Goal: Echo guides you through learning — e.g.,

“Echo, teach me companion planting.”
Steps:

Read saved articles aloud section by section.

Option to save new info from the web along the way.
